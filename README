The two code that is shown here are classes that connects to my deployed REST web service that I deployed
to map the lattitude and longitude of each user's into Google Map and ListView. The implementation of the web service 
can be found at webservice.php

This is a project that I have been working on during my free time for the past 2 months. It is still under development and
there are still more features to be added to the final product. Some known issues that is been fixed are memory leaks and
code optimization. Loading the data from the backend using the current approach is very heavy. Caching part of the data 
on the iPhone would be the next reasonable step.
